## üìù How It Works
1. **Voice Command Input**: User speaks commands like "move forward" or "turn left" into a mobile app.
2. **Bluetooth Communication**: Commands are sent to the car via a Bluetooth module.
3. **Microcontroller Processing**: Arduino processes the command and triggers appropriate actions (e.g., motor rotation).
4. **Car Movement**: Car performs actions like moving forward, backward, turning, or stopping.
